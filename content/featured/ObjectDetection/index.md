Vehicle Object Detection object is one of the projects developed while interning at [VarX](https://varx.id/). This project is a research project aimed at interns in the AI Developer division to develop real-time object detection and processing using a mobile application platform. The point of this research project is that in the future, if [VarX](https://varx.id/) employees develop an object detection application in real-time, they will get documentation or research results that will be useful later for further development because previously existing employees have never developed a project like this. often referred to as a pilot project
