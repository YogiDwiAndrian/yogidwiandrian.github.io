Hello! Interestingly, I'm a final year undergraduate student at Universitas Teknologi Yogyakarta majoring Informatics and minoring Intelligent System. I really like all sciences related to technology, one of which is data science and android development. My determination and dedication that I highlight is taking part in various programs to develop my skills such as taking Google Bangkit 2021, completed the [Android](https://www.dicoding.com/learningpaths/7) and [ML](https://www.dicoding.com/learningpaths/30) path to an advanced level in Dicoding.

Fast forward to today, and I have the privilege of intern for a [software house company](https://varx.id/). My main focus today is building object detection systems for governance and machine learning model development

I've also been certified [Tensorflow Developer Certificate](https://www.credential.net/8e9183ba-f7da-401b-aead-590e21a3407a).

Here are a few technologies Iâ€™ve been working with recently:
