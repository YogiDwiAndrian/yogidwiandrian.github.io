The last project from Dicoding is in the [applied machine learning class (advanced)](https://www.dicoding.com/academies/319-machine-learning-terapan). Create a recommendation system based on preferred authors in order to increase someone's reading interest. In making this system, it is required to describe everything about the project overview, business understanding, understanding data, data preparation, modeling, and evaluation. From the project I'm working on, I get very good feedback and get five stars.
